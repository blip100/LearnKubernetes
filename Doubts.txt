-   When you hit https://synchat.internal your etc/hosts is checked
    IP is hit from there to ingress controller 
    It will redirect you based on the rules defined to corresponding service
    but this doesn't work if minikube - use tunnel 

-   Why rewrite URL design is chosen in ingress annotations? 
    what was the problem? - CH6 explained someting i dont get it - use GPT and try

-   Why don't I need kubectl proxy anymore?
    - because ingress controller is running in the cluster and it is exposed to the outside world
    - ingress controller is a reverse proxy that routes traffic to the appropriate service based on the rules defined in the ingress resource

-   Why do I need pvc in the api deployment?
    - because the api service needs to store data persistently, and pvc provides a way to do that
    - pvc is a way to request storage from the cluster, and it is bound to a persistent volume that is created by the cluster administrator

-   What is the API they were talking about int Kubernetes:CH7:L8 ?
-   Last paragraph of CH8:L4 talks about the design, which I didn't get
